# My_Portfolio

Hi! Thank you for visiting my personal portfolio.
To navigate, simply just open the files in the folder. In case you didn't know, I have a dedicated portfolio website [**HERE**](https://edricnes.github.io/EdricPortfolio.github.io/) for easier navigation and overviews.

If you decide to browse through here, pdfs are supposed to be complimentary to each sql file in the same folder.
If there is a pdf, opening the two files in multi-window setup is recommended!

The page will get updated with more content/files as soon as I can during my off time (if you're seeing very few now).
Thanks for reading and I personally appreciate every one that checks my portfolio repository.

God Bless You, and have a nice day!
