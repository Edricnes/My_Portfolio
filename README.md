# My_Portfolio
Hi! Thank you for visiting my personal portfolio.
To navigate, simply just open the files in the folder. In case you didn't know, I have a dedicated portfolio website: https://edricnes.github.io/EdricPortfolio.github.io/

If you decide to browse through here, where there are two files in each folder, then those two are related and supplementary to each other.
If that is the case, opening the two files in multi-window setup is recommended!

The page will get updated with more content/files as soon as I can during my off time (if you're seeing very few now).
Thanks for reading and I personally appreciate every one that checks my portfolio repository.

God Bless You, and have a nice day!
