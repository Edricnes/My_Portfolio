To view the dashboard in PowerPoint (can be downloaded), click [**HERE**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yrqyrGkMShsmV6RJmv6Ki1a-yOSeKEN4/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=118397987194248523615&rtpof=true&sd=true).

Or fancy opening it up in your own Power BI app? You can get it [**HERE**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QwKf_A5YQuHVItk-2b_E8bRjfIFZ9Vw5/view?usp=share_link).

If your own Office account has Power BI, the PowerPoint option should be good as you can interact with the data there without using Power BI as well.

Also, there are descriptions of the dashboard in the PowerPoint file to provide more context and background.

Thank you for visiting!
