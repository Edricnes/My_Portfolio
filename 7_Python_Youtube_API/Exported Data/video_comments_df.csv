The dutch, english and french did nothing different during colonialism then they did previously in europe and with each other and nothing differtent than what african tribes/societies did with each other and what asian countries did with each other for thousands of years.

As a journalist and online educator, I'm deeply troubled by the dated ideas and constraints that surround sex education.

And ideally, both people should be on some form of birth control.', '19:45  I aint gettin my balls stabbed', 'Have you noticed that all the people in favor of birth control are already born?', ""I think two side effects of a male pill should be very concerning. Low Testosterone can lead to all sorts of problems. But more concerning would be mood swings in the gender that is already more aggressive. Perhaps the biggest reason anabolic steroids are illegal. Over or under aggressive behavior by men is not good for society. I'm all for a male pill. I do think more comfortable condoms that don't take away from the pleasure of sex would be a good thing too. At least as a stop gap until a viable male pill is on the market or as continued protection from STDs."", '“Stop changing the sperm’s head to look like a hook” made me laugh so hard.', 'I’m never even going to consider taking a male contraception pill or something of the sort, and I think a vast majority of men feel the same way. These companies know that also, therefore they won’t invest in it. \n\nI’m pro vaccination and western medicine ofcourse, but putting something in your body that messes with your hormones, or in the very least stops one of the most fundamental prosesses in the body, is clearly crossing a line for me. \n\nAs for female prevention I see the benefit, ofcourse. I think I would be hesitant however, if I were a woman. I would only use a copper spiral atleast. \n\nAs for us men, we don’t really run the same risks as women when it comes to pregnancy. Worst case for us would be paying child support. And I will concede that child support would be a setback for Many guys.\n\nWomen on the other hand risks far more than «just a setback», so the benefit kind of outweighs the risks in ways it just doesn’t for men. \n\nIn conclusion i think way to Many girls are on the pill or other kinds of contraception. It is often given to them at age 15/16, when they are not mature enough to make that choice. The side effects are also blood cloths, rare, but when they occur often fatal. Also it changes their personality, taste in men, etc. \n\nNot saying women should or should not take it, it is mostly safe. Just saying that it should be an informed decision.', 'I only recently found this video.  My wife suffered a heart attack partly because of the pill.

But the thing with our French Overseas Territories is that Paris sees them like actual parts of France. Even if there are penguins, even if there are coconut trees or were nuked to smithereens, these territories are as French as places like Montpellier, the Massif Central or the beaches of Normandy are. They receive the exact same amount of voting power as those in the Hexagon, they can vote for the President, the Legislatives (the equivalent of the midterms in the US) and also participate in national referendums. They have access to the exact same healthcare system as in France, and sure resources distribution and social inequality may not be as fully-fledged and solved as they are on the mainland (though blame that on their geographic position mostly) but they do receive financial aid from Paris, helping them develop as much as they can like the France in Europe (Nickel mining in NC, space tourism in Guyane, tourism in general in Reunion, potential Olympics in Polynesia etc.) They also pay the exact same taxes as any other citizens in the Hexagon. \n\nWe don't see them as territories we rule over anymore, we see them as actual integral part of France. It doesn't really matter personally if New Caledonia wants their independence for example, but the majority wants to stay with France because they know very well, like every others overseas territory, what happens if they leave the French nation. They are fully responsible for that, they can leave whenever they want, but when China knocks on their doors or when sea levels swallow them up, that's when some of the many issues can arise, with neo-colonialism, environmental issues, more social inequality etc. cause by the fact that most of them can't even sustain themselves on their own, and could end up like Haiti or the Comoros. \n\nThere are also many places that, unlike the many islands good old Uncle Sam, the Spanish, Portuguese or British stole, were completely inhabited thanks to colorization. New Caledonian tribes lived on their island way before the French arrived so that's where your argument can stand, but Reunion was completely empty, only being visited by Arab traders or Austronesians on their way to Madagascar. It was then populated by convicts, and today Reunion has a very distinct culture that did resist the mainland French cultural hegemony, and for us folks in the Hexagon we absolutely love the fact that they tried to not give up their ways and culture to a European lifestyle. They also have some special statuses, some with more autonomy, so in a way we do partially leave them alone. Some even have their own sovereign, similar to how in Indonesia there are still sultans and other sovereigns for a few places.\n\nAnd again, New Caledonia, Guyane, Reunion and all those territories (inhabited ones) can just leave France, that is completely fine and it's their decision, even though it can hurt our geopolitical influence in a way, in the end France itself can find ways to prosper without those territories, and it would be good luck to them to try and be successful independent nations. But still, they can vote whenever they want to leave us. I don't think we can say the same with Hawaii, American Samoa or heck even Washington DC, where not only people don't have the same voting power as the rest of the US, but they pay the exact same taxes, decided by others for them, something you don't see in France.

Belligerents included much of\xa0Europe, the\xa0Russian Empire, the\xa0United States, and the\xa0Ottoman Empire, with fighting occurring throughout Europe, the\xa0Middle East,\xa0Africa, the\xa0Pacific, and parts of\xa0Asia. An estimated 9\xa0million soldiers were killed in combat, plus another 23 million wounded, while 5\xa0million civilians died as a result of military action,\xa0hunger, and\xa0disease.[2]\xa0Millions more died in\xa0genocides within the Ottoman Empire\xa0and the\xa01918 influenza pandemic, which was\xa0exacerbated\xa0by the movement of combatants during the war.[3][4]\n\nPrior to 1914, the European\xa0great powers\xa0were divided between the\xa0Triple Entente, comprising\xa0France, Russia, and\xa0Britain, and the\xa0Triple Alliance, containing\xa0Germany,\xa0Austria-Hungary, and\xa0Italy. Tensions in the\xa0Balkans\xa0came to a head on 28\xa0June\xa01914 following the\xa0assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the Austro-Hungarian heir, by\xa0Gavrilo Princip, a\xa0Bosnian Serb. Austria-Hungary blamed\xa0Serbia, which led to the\xa0July Crisis, an unsuccessful attempt to avoid conflict through diplomacy. On 28 July 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, and Russia came to the latter\'s defence. By 4 August, the system of entangling alliances drew in Germany, France, and Britain, along with their respective colonies, although Italy initially remained neutral. In November 1914, the Ottoman Empire,\xa0Germany, and Austria-Hungary formed the\xa0Central Powers, and on\xa026 April 1915, Italy joined Britain, France, Russia, and Serbia as the\xa0Allies of World War I.\n\nFacing a war on two fronts,\xa0German strategy\xa0in 1914 was to concentrate its forces on defeating France in six weeks, before moving them to the\xa0Eastern Front\xa0and doing the same to Russia.[5]\xa0However, this was defeated at the\xa0Marne\xa0in September 1914, and the year ended with the two sides facing each other along the\xa0Western Front, a continuous series of\xa0trenches\xa0stretching from the\xa0English Channel\xa0to\xa0Switzerland. The frontlines in the West changed little until 1917, while the Eastern Front was far more fluid, with both Austria-Hungary and Russia gaining and losing large swathes of territory. Other significant theatres included the\xa0Middle East,\xa0Italy,\xa0Asia Pacific, and the\xa0Balkans, which drew\xa0Bulgaria,\xa0Romania, and\xa0Greece\xa0into the war.\n\nOver the course of 1915, both Russia and Austria-Hungary suffered enormous casualties in the East, while Allied offensives in\xa0Gallipoli\xa0and on the Western Front ended in failure. German attacks at\xa0Verdun\xa0in 1916, and a combined Franco-British offensive on the\xa0Somme\xa0cost participants heavy losses for limited strategic gains, while the Russian\xa0Brusilov offensive\xa0ground to a halt after early success. By 1917, Russia was on the verge of revolution, and the failure of the French\xa0Nivelle Offensive, as well as costly British attacks in\xa0Flanders, meant all belligerents were short of manpower and under severe economic stress.\n\nShortages caused by the Allied naval blockade led Germany to initiate\xa0unrestricted submarine warfare\xa0in early 1917,\xa0bringing the previously-neutral United States into the war\xa0on 6\xa0April\xa01917. In Russia, the\xa0Bolsheviks\xa0seized power in the 1917\xa0October Revolution\xa0and exited the war with the March 1918\xa0Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, freeing up large numbers of German troops. The\xa0German General Staff\xa0used these additional resources to launch the\xa0March 1918 offensive, which was halted by stubborn Allied defence, heavy casualties, and supply shortages. When the Allies began the\xa0Hundred Days Offensive\xa0in August, the\xa0Imperial German Army\xa0continued to fight hard but could only slow the advance, not stop it.[6]\n\nTowards the end of 1918, the Central Powers began to collapse; Bulgaria signed an armistice on 29\xa0September, followed by the Ottomans on 31\xa0October, then Austria-Hungary on 3\xa0November. Isolated, facing the\xa0German Revolution\xa0at home and a military on the verge of mutiny,\xa0Kaiser Wilhelm\xa0abdicated on 9\xa0November, and the new German government signed the\xa0Armistice of 11 November 1918, bringing the conflict to a close. The\xa0Paris Peace Conference\xa0of 1919–1920 imposed various settlements on the defeated powers, with the best-known of these being the\xa0Treaty of Versailles. The dissolution of the\xa0Russian Empire\xa0in 1917, the\xa0German Empire\xa0in 1918, the\xa0Austria-Hungarian Empire\xa0in 1920, and the\xa0Ottoman Empire\xa0in 1922, led to\xa0numerous uprisings\xa0and the creation of independent states, including\xa0Poland,\xa0Czechoslovakia, and\xa0Yugoslavia.

Everything is on chips. Even things, like acoustic warning, that someone sitting in a seat is not strapped in, when this could could have been done with a single circuit. All you'd need, is a trigger, when car reaches certain speed, a weigh sensor in the seat (which could literally be spring based), contacts in the female side of the seat belt joint, a buzzer, some wiring and a pair of relays per seat (weight sensor triggers one relay, closed circuit through seat belt joint disengages the other)! Outdated? Sure. Does it get the job done and lower exposure to one particular component, which requires special resources? Yes.\nI for one believe, that Just In Time is BS, precisely, because shit happens. We are already at point, where transportation companies report hourly positions of their trucks and trains, because a manufacturing process doesn't have a day of materials on hand! Imagine, you have to change production, because the driver hit a deer. It's ridiculous! And it doesn't need to be of natural causes or coincidence, it could be man made by a speculation! Stockpiling doesn't solve that! The only thing, which does, is getting more involved in the supply chain. There's no way VolksWagen group didn't know, how reliant they are on particular commodities, yet they didn't build a FAB to cover some percentage of their demand, nor did they buy a copper mine and processing companies, which could provide them internally with necessary wiring (given the forced electrification)! Are you freaking kidding me?! There's no way, they didn't see situation like this coming. Maybe not due to natural reasons, but definitely because of political ones and they still did nothing! \nWhat I'd like to see, is approach, which eliminates strategic threats to manufacturing system. The most prevalent one these days, is that everything is done in China. Nothing against China (well, except basically everything they've done past decade), but the fact, that basically all manufacturing is done there at scale has become a bottleneck in the system, that is prone to clogging, due to political reasons. What I'd do, is I would find three locations on Earth with decent, all be it not perfect environment for manufacturing, preferably on different continents, and I'd build manufacturing hubs there. There wouldn't have been that big variety (at least within a model Octavia for European and Indian markets are on completely different base models), but there would be bigger interoperability. Say there were plants in the EU, mostly focused on European market and R&D, plants in Egypt, mostly exporting to Africa and plants in India handling local market and parts of Asia, China, if at the time there were a presence there, would be it's own system. All plants would buy from the nearest suppliers of required materials and run between 80 to 90% capacity. Why? Precisely because of shit like Covid or political meltdowns! This way, even if a entire continent went down, you'd have two thirds to a half of capacity secure and you could ramp up, if need presented itself, at cost of time spent on system optimization and short term reduction of maintenance at particular plants.""]"

3CuPqeIJr3U,"[""I just wanted to bring a few things up before anyone else does because I'm sure this video (relating to a couple of hot-button issues) will invite some criticism.\n\n- There's a section at 7:31 where we talk about how in general, Chinese vaccines are not as effective as those from Moderna and Pfizer. On screen, we show their different efficacy ratings, and I know there was a popular video by Vox this week that explained why you can't directly compare vaccines to each other off of their efficacy ratings. This is absolutely true, but the general message here, that the attenuated/inactivated virus and other older technologies used by the five currently-approved Chinese vaccines are not as effective compared to those of Moderna and Pfizer is true--mRNA vaccines are known to be more effective than other technologies, and that's part of what makes them such an exciting technology. You can read this article by the Harvard Medical School for an explanation as to why and how: https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/why-are-mrna-vaccines-so-exciting-2020121021599\n\n- I want to reiterate the point that I hope the video does: any country donating vaccines to others that have a reduced level of access is a good thing. This video does not criticize that. It merely criticizes the manner in which this is being done. In addition, it brings up the point that this could be strategically problematic for China, based on their own interests. There's definitely the flip side of that which is to say that China is sacrificing vaccinating its population in order to give doses to those that need them most, which is valiant. But again, its not the action this video is criticizing, it's the method.\n\n- Also, yes: China mismanaged the epidemic in the beginning, denied its existence, suppressed whistleblowers, etc. Once it flipped the script and started taking action, though, it quickly became one of the countries with one of the most effective suppression programs. While there is some legitimate doubt about numbers and statistics in the early days of the epidemic in China, there's no legitimate doubt that China has effectively suppressed the virus to very low levels of transmission now."", ""this didn't age well at all did it, and it wasn't even very accurate at the time, at least on a few key points. \n\ncurrently, given current variants, it looks like herd immunity isn't possible at any coverage.\n\nand China has no interest in reopening to join the mess we've got out here.\n\nAlso mRNA vaccines are faster to get into production, but it really doesn't scale that well, the technology to make the lipid droplet emulsion is very new and nobody had it yet, whereas the technology to make the old fashioned inactivated vaccines was well established and scales fairly easily."", 'Now before I actually start watching this video I can actually already feel all of the rasist comments in the comment section actually trash taking about my country and actually being racist', 'Without doing war how you destroy', 'China s biggest and  successful operation...wah kya baat hai', 'Not enough emphasis on the decreased effectiveness of Sinovax.

Security: as we've all seen the slugfest(s) and other egregious acts on youtube and elsewhere is it any wonder why there's a uptick in corporate aviation?! and why would you want somebody eavesdropping on sensitive company information?! 4. justification for corporate flights really comes from the individual traditional operational structures such as your basic traditional individual stores like walmart, supermarkets, convenience stores / gas stations,  and other well-known retail /apparel offerings. and of course meeting with federal, state, and local officials when needed. it's less about the number of associates that you employ and more so about the businesses themselves that justify the operations of corporate jets. For a perfect example of this my local walmart employs a skeleton crew but yet they still make millions each year another fine example of this is a local supermarket in my area they also employ very little associates but yet they're one of the top grossing stores in the chain that also makes millions of dollars each year. 4.

Paris is also a geographically tiny city of 2,5 million with suburbs of 9,5 million, many in cars from the burbs but with a great commuter rail system to the center - the RER. ie, spread out Queens, etc, is not in Paris, rather other departements.  One can still walk across Paris in two hours."", '0:14 paris', 'Actually, You were very wrong from the core when you were speaking about ""the history of European cities.\n\n01. There were not many cities like London in the ""old ages"" and talking like ""Europe was like this, because London was"" is basically incorrect.\nMost of the ""big cities"" in Europe had not more than 40-80k population and only a few were big enough to compare.\n\n02. You need to remember that most of the ""rich people"" in London were living not in London, but ""in the City"", and that was the autonomic town in London. And they lived there, because ""The City"" had - and has today as well - its privileges like lower taxes, big autonomy from the crown and ofc. harbor for trade.\nSo, of course, rich people would be interested in living there, not in the other parts of London.\nIt\'s a bit of this same situation in Beverly Hills - where Rich people are living not because of ""walking distance"", but because of their autonomy from LA.\n\n03.  ""Hotels had the best of their rooms on the lowest floors - because no elevator"".\n\nWrong again. Hotels had the best rooms on the lower floors, not because of walking distance - rich people had their own service - but because of the infrastructure of the age.\nBasically, the water pumps were a lot worse in that time than nowadays, so it was costly to maintain high elevated rooms with big amounts of water which the rich people like to have.\nSo placing the rooms with higher expectations on the lower floors.\nAnd that does not mean that there were no super VIP rooms on the highest floors - they actually were.\nThey were very costly to rent and were usually reserved for princes or billionaires who needed prestige and the 50 more steps to move were not a problem there.\nI would say more - there were a lot of situations in XVIII-XIX century, where the way to move was intentionally increased by builders just to improve the status of the owner - for example the entrance to the  City Hall of the City of Zamosc which was the private city of polish Zamoysky family.\nThey decided during building time, that if You move to the City Hall, you need to show respect and climb a lot of stairs just to move to the main entrance gate.\n\n04. You said that ""cities had similar sizes, no matter the population because people needed to communicate around the city"".\nSorry, but again, that is not true.\nDuring the XVIII-XIX century, there was a strict hierarchy in society. Your life highly depended on your family status. People from the lower or middle classes rarely left the space of 4-5 streets they lived and worked in.\nIf you were a poor man, then there was no chance for You to move to the rich part of the city - if you did, most probably guards would kick your ass, and throw you back into the filthy little street, where you moved out. And if you were rich then you mostly used horses to commute - as a sign of your status.\nSo even if the city were 10 miles across, most of the people would still stay in their ""500x500 meters world""\n\nActually, the only reason You made small cities was that it was easier to defend, and cheaper to maintain city walls.\nBut again, in parallel the cost of the city paid for it was high - cities were highly polluted, diseases were spreading, and places were highly flammable. Ofc. a high population of poor people was a problem as well.\nAnd if You move outside England, You will see that rich families, actually often prefer living not in the cities, but more in the suburbs - where they could place big palaces, gardens, etc.\nAnd even if they lived inside the cities, then - as I mentioned earlier - that space was unaccessible for the poor people so it was again like a city inside the city (closed space).\n\n05. ""European farmers used to live in small towns and move to their fields during the day, then on the farms like in America.""\n\nAgain - You didn\'t mention the social situation in Europe during the XVII-XVIII century.\nDuring that time Europe was in the age of absolutist monarchies. It was the dawn of the age of ""free cities"".\nSo basically often people were chained to the place they were living by their obligations/duties. The other thing is that there were a lot of wars during the XVII-XIX century in Europe, so staying in communities - especially on lowlands - was at least a small chance of self-defense against marauders or enemy raiders.\nPrarllely in the mountains people were often living on solo farms because from the one side noblemen had no interest in grouping people and from the other side war actions in the mountains were rare.\n\nSo basically the shape of the XVII-XIX century settlements was decided not by the ""distance of walk"", but by external threats and the shape of the European social structure of the time. It\'s hard to place it on today\'s realities.']"

If you enter the country via rail meanwhile you end up at Woodlands Train Checkpoint which is even further from downtown than Changi Airport; to get to downtown you 1st need a connecting bus to the nearest MRT (subway/metro station), some of which are jam packed, while others sometimes will skip the Checkpoint as that area is just beside a busy border crossing that suffers from congestion.\nGoing back to Changi Airport, the areas where it may not be as good in are more related to its more restrictive regulations I think. For instance, even if you've printed your boarding pass before going to the airport, local aviation laws may still require you to Q at check-in desks to have your travel documents checked. There're also reports of lounge-hoppers being frustrated by security guards banning them from boarding the airside shuttle bus between Terminal 4 & the other terminals as they flight isn't departing from the terminal the bus is heading to. Not sure if its due to Terminal 4 having its common security checkpoint at the entrance to its airside area (immediately behind the departure immigration hall), while other terminals have those checkpoints at each gate instead.

In Europe and Asia, flying is often a choice. There are fast and reliable high speed rail networks that give the airlines a run for their money, especially when you factor in the convenience of a downtown station over an airport far outside the city. The airports have no choice but to invest in passenger comfort, because passengers very easily can decide that they just won't fly. In the United States, they know that they have passengers over a barrel. If I want to go from say Reno to Minneapolis, I can fly with a connection in Denver with a total travel time of about 9 hours (including arriving early for security). It will be an awful experience, but I can leave in the morning and be there in time for dinner. If I wanted to take the train, it would take over three days to get there... and frankly, unless I pay the extra for a room on the train, it probably also will be an unpleasant experience (minute for minute, the train is definitely more pleasant than being on a plane, but there is something to be said for it being over quicker).

The shady business trip with all expences paid, looked very much like bribery, although no one has been found guilty of bribery in a court of law so far as I know. Anyway, good job on the video. There are however some... inaccuracies as I see it. You start the video by suggesting that Yngve Slyngstad is responsible for the ethical investment by-law of the norwegian sovereign wealth fund. This isn't so. The finance department of Norway (through a regulatory ethical council) oversees this, and so Nicolai Tangen doesn't have the power to negate this trend. An interesting coincidence is that the current leader of the ethical council, Johan Andresen, inherited a vast fortune made primarily by selling tobacco products, one of the investment areas that are off limits to the wealth fund. This is just a side note, as the family is no longer in this line of business, and Andresen himself by all accounts is an accomplished businessman. As was mentioned previously, Tangen made a decision to distance himself from his vast fortune before taking office, which you didn't accurately cover. As a last note, psychologically speaking, I personally think that Tangens motivation for taking the top job of the wealth fund, was probably prestige, not power. The distinction between the two can be hard to see, I agree, but I think it is important here. As the sovereign wealth fund is much more regulated than say, a private company, the power (though still great) of being CEO is not comparable to the power of being the CEO of, say, Apple. The prestige however, is probably one of the highest of any job in modern european finance circles, second only to the likes of Christine Lagarde.\n\nBtw, I gather that you're danish?

This is just a regime change. One country and two governments are exploring the issue of legitimacy. So far, the Communist Party and the Kuomintang have not signed a shutdown agreement, so it is still a civil war in a country, just a state of ceasefire. Why two countries? I don't understand. The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are only national names, and China is the country."", ""Of course, Taiwan cannot be completely equivalent to Ukraine (on the other hand, China and Russia are also different)\r\nHowever, it cannot be denied that Taiwan and Ukraine are largely similar.\r\nJudging from the international situation, both are pieces that the United States uses to contain other countries. The United States used Ukraine to suppress Russia and fetter the EU; Use Taiwan to suppress China and fetter Japan.\r\nHistorically, Ukraine has been integrated with Russia for a long time, regardless of whether the name of Russia at that time was Tsar Russia or the Soviet Union. Similarly, Taiwan has long been integrated with China, regardless of whether China's name at that time was Daming, the Qing Dynasty or the Republic of China. In fact, in the history of Ukraine, there was only a short period of independence from 1918 to 1922. In addition, from 1991 to the present, it is only 35 years in total, which is shorter than the time when Taiwan and China separated.\r\nIn my opinion, apart from the differences in geographical location, population, military strength and economy, the biggest difference between the two is that Ukraine gained legal independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Due to Gorbachev's incompetence and Yeltsin's selfishness, Russia was unable to prevent Ukraine from becoming independent. Ukraine became an independent country and was recognized internationally, including China, the United States and even Russia itself. Once this legal recognition becomes a reality, it is difficult to reverse it. On the contrary, Taiwan has never been independent from China in legal principle, and even Taiwan's own constitution is the Constitution of the Republic of China, which is essentially the continuation of the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China. The overwhelming majority of countries in the international community do not recognize Taiwan as a sovereign and independent country, and the United Nations has no seat. Taiwan's media always like to say that there are many countries supporting Taiwan internationally. In fact, Taiwan has only 14 friendly countries, which are basically small countries whose names are not easy to write correctly (no intention of insulting these countries, but they are really too small and have no sense of existence). The so-called friendly countries are just looking for Taiwan to make money when they are short of money."", 'I had my doubts before but this video definitely confirms that Taiwan is not in fact, Ukraine.', ""I am from Taiwan thank you very much make video 🤗 China has been bullying Taiwan in various ways for a long time   Military  threats, diplomatic intimidation, theft of high-tech patents China is most afraid of Taiwan's freedom and democracy Dictatorship, violence, lies, restriction of all freedom, Taiwan people hate it😒"", 'Hmmm so what your saying is Ukraine is taiwan', 'Taiwan is a part of China', ""As a Taiwanese live in Banqiao, this video is pretty accurate.

It only exists because of friction that exists between investing in and out of China. If China decides to loosen financial regulations, which it has already begun doing, Hong Kong becomes redundant. That has already begun happening, and that is why Shanghai has grown so much. While HK inherits the British legal system, that means exactly nothing because people are using HK to get to China, so you basically have to deal with Chinese law regardless. \n\nBasically, HK is too close to China but at the same time not close enough to China. Those who want access to Asia, British legal system, and English speaking population without being beholden to China will go to Singapore. People who want to invest in China will go to Shanghai.\n\nIronically, though, had HK not been the gateway to China, it would've suffocated under the weight of all the monopolies."", 'I think what Polymatter is trying to push forward here is not that ""free market is bad as it will always lead to monopolies and corporatocracy"" but rather ""Hong Kong is corporatocracy disguising itself as free market"", as real free markets will want to ensure fair competition through the lack of government favoritism (for example, the government in this case regulating the frequency of bus companies, or allowing only one company the right to import cattle goods) and cooperate subsidization from government, as government subsidization of companies only imbalances competition within the free market as corporations receiving government subsidization receive an additional funding from government, compared to other companies which only revenue is from the profit motive, only leading to more monopolies. Such example of a ""true"" free market may be Singapore, where government lobbying and cooperate subsidization is very low, but where government regulation is low as well. \n\nThe thing about economic freedom indexes such as the ones from the Fraser Institute, The Heritage Foundation or the Cato-Institute, is that they only measure ""freeness"" to the extent of a lack of government regulation, government spending, taxes, property rights, rule of law, but not measure the amount of government favoritism in terms of corporate subsidization. Thus which is why I would argue that Singapore is more ""free market"" than Hong Kong, despite being slightly more regulatory according to the aforementioned indexes (in most of them, Singapore ranks 2nd behind Hong Kong), as it\'s government does not take sides in the free market through subsidization or corporate favoritism.\n\nThe issue also comes to the meritocracy in the idea of civil society and free market.

I think there are so many more factors to consider - I wouldn\'t say that the ""land couldn\'t be shared because people are inherently greedy."" First, I think this depends a lot on education and cultural values/societal satisfaction. And secondly, I think this fails to address the difference between economic freedom and personal freedom - if someone is making huge profits from something, I.e. they have a monopolistic company, they fall into the economic category. You could make it so that larger economic giants get shorter patents and are only allowed patents if they commit to improving the satisfaction of society, reducing waste, developing new \'products,\' improving the safety of their products etc, and after a certain level of net profit, they take on the responsibility to reinvest all of their profits into improving society for all. This allows them the patent, I.e. to continue doing what they clearly want to do without worrying about copycats, but by the same token incentivises that they take the responsibility that having a large stake in the world entails. Smaller start ups without cash could get patents which are longer, on the premise that holding that patent however does mean that you will have to take responsibility for improving society if you do start making big bucks while still holding the patent.

Human ego is disgusting.\n\nIntelligence doesn\'t make one animal more special than another. Just a trait humans have. No better than running or flying. Evolution has no will. It\'s not trying to make other animals more human-like. A slug is as evolved as we are. A slug got it right.\n\nIt doesn\'t make you inherently better at all, and that totally disregards how stupid, evil humans are. That\'s human ego. The second an alien race arrives that\'s more intelligent than we are, you will move the goalposts for what it means to be more special. You say it not because it\'s true, but because it currently benefits you.\n\nOnly animals of human-level intelligence are capable of evil. Wouldn\'t put the same level of responsibility on human children and mentally disabled people, and obviously shouldn\'t on animals of an entirely different species.

It\'s awesome. And it\'s what lets you be you.\n\nBreeding is evil. Other animals are forced to have sex, which is rape. Females are treated like conveyor belts, pumping out child after child, all of whom are kept from their fathers and kidnapped from their parents, causing massive distress, fear, panic, and confusion.

Not only is it extremely stressful for them, and wild animals are abused until they submit to human will, but how dare you deprive them of their life. Elephants that do tricks and give rides aren\'t happy. They do it out of fear of what happens if they refuse. Swimming with dolphins isn\'t a good activity.

As is exploiting, abusing, scaring, disrupting grindylows, fish, other animals in Great Lake.\n\nOther apes, monkeys, and horses used on cards aren\'t smiling because they\'re happy. They do a ""fear grimace"", smiling in submission. They\'re not happy, they\'re abused. Cats, dogs specifically bred over 1000s years live with humans. Other animals weren\'t. Kidnapped, locked in tiny cages and tanks for human amusement. They\'re not pet animals, they\'re slaves.\n\nExperimenting on other animals is evil.
