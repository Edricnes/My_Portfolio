Note: This is a developing story, and it’s moving quickly. Since we recorded this video, Russia has taken massive steps to implement its annexation playbook over the eastern regions of Ukraine. My hope is that this video can provide a foundation for you to understand the major building blocks of this strategy so that you can follow the news in the coming weeks and months to see how this plays out.

vLpSeMlfZ60,Johnny Harris,How Europe Stole the World,2022-08-10 12:00:40+00:00,"How Europe Dominated the Planet
Go to our sponsor https://betterhelp.com/JohnnyHarris for 10% off your first month of therapy with BetterHelp and get matched with a therapist who will listen and help.

Correction: 01:07 I characterize Europe as a “continent full of poor miserable farmers” and later go on to compare it to the “thriving” empires elsewhere. While it is indeed true that Europe in the 1400s was full of famine, plague, war, and general suffering, it’s inaccurate to say that Europeans were much worse off than people living in any other parts of the world. Especially if you look to Southern Europe where an explosion of art, science, and trade was taking place at this time. The accurate point would be to say that Europe had been relatively cut off from the world since the Ottoman Empire blocked them from historical trade routes. Europe was not deeply connected to global trade, which was mostly happening in the Indian Ocean regions at that time.

Correction: 04:50 see the correction from 01:07

Correction: 05:43 As noted earlier, Europeans had trade connections with the east. During this time they were cut off by the Ottoman Empire for the reasons I explain in the video

Correction: 07:21 While Portugal had gone out trading and exploring Western Africa first, I present it as if Portugal had made it to Asia before Spain decided to start exploring. This isn’t right. Columbus’ journey west (1492) happened a few years before Portugal’s first voyage that reached India (lead by Vasco da Gama in 1497).

Correction: 08:55 This little dramatization mischaracterizes what happened here. As many have pointed it out it feels like I’m asserting that Columbus “invented” imperialism in this moment. And indeed the way this is presented implies that. Columbus did NOT invent the idea of taking over land. In fact, a part of his contract with the royals was that he would take over any land he could while on this journey. The important point here is that Columbus set out to get in on trade in the east, but that the “discovery” of the America’s turned those efforts away from looking for new trade routes, to a full blown imperial project in the Americas. That’s the point I was trying ot make, but missed the mark in this overly dramatized moment.

Correction: 16:02 In addition “their weapons” and “their city germs” It would have been more accurate to mention a major tool for the conquerors which was the exploitation of local politics and alliances. The conquest of these huge swaths of land required Europeans to ally with and rely on local expertise and man power to colonize these territories. 


The Library of Congress has a wonderful map collection which I used to get high res versions of a lot of these old maps. Thank you Library of Congress!

The future of abortion rights in America just got a bit more complicated now that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. It makes me wonder, when is there actually going to be a male birth control pill?

Thank you to all of the people who sent in their experiences with hormonal birth control. Your voices are so important in this story. One of those was Sarah Dietschy, you can see her Youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/saradietschy. So many of you responded with how hormonal birth control has made your life better. We didn’t have time to include these in the video, but you can watch some of those testimonials with this link: https://youtu.be/tHpZOKWCcnI

Julian Assange has a long, complicated past. But regardless of what you think of him and what he did, you should care about what happens to him. Here’s why.

Check out two very solid documentaries on Assange for a deeper understanding of him as a person:
- Risk (2016), by Laura Poitras (we used a little footage from that doc in the intro)
- We Steal Secrets (2013), by Alex Gibney

The recent escalation in hostilities in Ukraine has put at least 7.5 million children in grave danger of physical harm, severe emotional distress, and displacement. Save the Children have been in Ukraine since 2014, and are on the ground near the Ukrainian border providing people with life-saving assistance as they flee the conflict. Please donate, every little bit counts.

This is Putin’s war and to understand it you have to look at the story Putin tells himself and the Russian people that helped justify this invasion. In this video I explore Putin’s motive and make the case that Russia has already lost this war.

Thank you to the excellent reporting by: The New York Times, The BBC, Reuters, The Economist. Thank you to all those on the ground who sent me videos and perspectives about the situation.

What happens if China invades Taiwan? Here’s how the start of World War 3 might go down.

For this video I leaned on some excellent interviews and research form:
Oriana Skylar Mastro: https://fsi.stanford.edu/people/oriana-skylar-mastro
Michael O’Hanlon: https://www.brookings.edu/experts/michael-e-ohanlon/

Also, Reuters did a similar speculative piece using some really compelling visuals: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/taiwan-china-wargames/

Ian Easton’s research using PLA internal documents was a strong foundation for my reporting on this: https://project2049.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Chinas-Top-Five-War-Plans_Ian_Easton_Project2049.pdf

I will never be able to look at bananas the same way again. The history behind this fruit is filled with government coups, propaganda, and predatory corporations.
This is the story of how US imperialism gave us crappy bananas - and why the ones in your kitchen might be doomed.

I went to a country that ‘doesn’t exist’ at least on the map. But it’s a place that sure feels like a real country. Being here is a reminder that international relations can often ignore the realities on the ground, and the people who live in these places. For me it’s important to not just look at these places on a map but to go and see them. Feel them. Talk to the people who live there. That’s what this fourth and final episode from Cyprus is about. I hope you enjoy.

Thanks to Thomas (  @Yes Theory  ) and  @Nathaniel Drew   for coming along with me and discussing this story around the fire. Thomas told his story from the trip here: https://youtu.be/vdkQWgZLrYA

I took great care to tell this story. There is so much pain wrapped up in it. And in this episode I could only tell one little slice of the modern day version of the divided island of Cyprus. But that's what series are for! there are three more episodes in this series and the next one will take a closer look at what this all looks like today. How it feels like to live on a divided island. Episode 3 will then go deep into the north of the island, talking to Turkish Cypriots and hearing their story. Episode 4 isn't that serious. It's about donkeys. 
There's no way I can tell all the stories and if you are from this island you probably have a version of these stories that doesn't fit what I've told here. Please just trust I tried my best.

Tom Fox composed the music for this video really helped take the quality to the next level. He's good, and he can make music for you too: https://tfbeats.com/

qw-FLc7Z01Q,Johnny Harris,How China Became So Powerful,2021-01-28 13:43:30+00:00,"It's a story of a certain type of capitalism 
If you want to learn more,  check out this article from the WEF https://bit.ly/39s92kl or for a deeper dive, the full book was published yesterday (I've read it. it's good!): https://amzn.to/3ordkwC
This video is a story about China, past to present. But in telling the story of the Rise of China (and Asia generally), it's impossible to not talk about fundamental lessons that have emerged. In this video I try to tell the story but then also look back and at the result of it all. To examine the data and see what effects our global economic system has had on people and the planet. The data is clear that our model of capitalism has some major winners. But it also produces some important losers, those who have lost out or have been damaged by these trends. One major loser of the this system is the future generations of people who will live on a planet with more extreme and volatile weather and ocean patterns. All of this calls for a rethinking of our capitalism. Not to scrap it all together, but to upgrade it to a version that benefits all of society and doesn't threaten our planet and future generations. 
Thanks for watching.

GLy4VKeYxD4,Johnny Harris,How to Remember Your Life,2019-03-18 16:02:56+00:00,"Most of your life you just can't remember. 
All music made specifically for this video by Producer Tom Fox. https://tfbeats.com/ 
At that link you can buy his music for your own videos if you want.

This video explores how I organize pictures. You probably have more pictures than you know what to do with. Phones are amazing for taking lots of shots but often the result is too many photos. I have been thinking about how to organize photos for a really long time and this is my workflow to best remember your life by using photos. It uses cloud based storage between my phone and computer to help me see my photos often and it also uses some guiding concepts that help me delete more photos and better enjoy the ones I keep around. I hope this helps at least one person better remember their lives.

China has huge ambitions for the 21st century. But it’s demographic problems will be a significant challenge on the way there.

This includes a paid sponsored promotion which had no part in the writing, editing, or production of the rest of the video.

Music by Epidemic Sound: http://epidemicsound.com

Demographic explanations are inspired in part by several chapters of “The Accidental Superpower” by Peter Zeihan. It’s a great book and although this video is only a small slice (and not the main argument), it’s very interesting and worth reading. He’s the source of a couple specific phrasings like “countries can’t manufacture 18 year olds” which I think help explain the issue well.
