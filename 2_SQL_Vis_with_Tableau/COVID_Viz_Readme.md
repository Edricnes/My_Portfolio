To view the Tableau visualization, here's the URL: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/edricnes/viz/Covid_Dashboard_16658607710170/Dashboard1

This viz was made on a FHD monitor (1920x1080).

In my experience viewing it on the web with different resolutions greatly affect the readability of the dashboard as the fonts and the layout's sizes are automatically adjusted.

If you so desire, the dashboard can be downloaded and opened up on your own Tableau app. There the layout and the sizings make more sense and can be modified.

Thank you for visiting!
